# AIML_PA1_M5_1

In this project, "Berkeley AIML Practical Application 1 - Module 5.1", it was asked to explore the data and utliize the attained knowledge of pandas,seaborn,numpy,matplotlib to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those (from provided .csv) who accepted and rejected the coupon. Below is my findings from the analysis and summary. Jupyter notebook link:

Customer Behavior Insights on Coupon Acceptance
Based on the data and visualizations:

1. Age and Acceptance Trends
Younger drivers, especially those under 30, were more likely to accept coupons—especially bar coupons—with acceptance rates reaching as high as 64.83%.

This suggests that age is positively associated with coupon responsiveness, with younger individuals being more receptive.

2. Gender Patterns
Men generally showed slightly higher coupon acceptance rates than women across various coupon types.

The difference, while not extreme, was consistent—particularly in categories like restaurants and bars.

3. Social and Lifestyle Indicators
Drivers who are socially active (e.g., frequenting bars more than once a month) were significantly more likely to accept bar coupons.

Those who had passengers, but were not tied down by family (no kids, not widowed), also had higher acceptance rates, indicating a more independent or social lifestyle increases likelihood of acceptance.

4. Financial Considerations
Budget-conscious individuals—for example, those who dine at cheap restaurants frequently and earn less than $50K—also showed relatively high acceptance, particularly for bar and restaurant coupons.

This suggests cost sensitivity is a driver of coupon acceptance.

5. Coupon Type Impact
Coupons for restaurants under $20, coffee houses, and carry-out showed generally higher acceptance rates than other types.

In contrast, bar coupons had more variability, heavily influenced by social habits and demographics.

Conclusion
Customers most likely to accept coupons tend to be young, socially active, and value-conscious. Gender plays a modest role, with men slightly more inclined to accept offers.
