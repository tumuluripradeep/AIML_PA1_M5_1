Analysis on Coupon Acceptance

Based on the data and visualizations:
1. Bar Coupon Analysis
    Customers most likely to accept bar coupons tend to be younger, socially active, and not widowed or with children.
    
    The highest acceptance rate (64.78%) is among those under 30 who go to bars more than once a month.
    
    Those with lower income (<$50K) who frequently visit cheap restaurants also show relatively high acceptance (60.25%).
    
    Being social (not alone or with children) and frequent bar-goers leads to an acceptance rate of 62.12%.
    Insight: Younger, more socially active individuals are more responsive to bar coupons.

2. Coffee House Coupon Analysis
    Coffee coupons appeal most to younger, frequent coffee drinkers, especially those with higher income or who are married.
    
    The top acceptance (66.79%) is from those under 30 who visit coffee houses regularly.
    
    Married coffee lovers with higher income also respond well (61.62%).
    
    People who avoid outings with kids and aren’t widowed accept at a rate of 55.71%.
    Insight: Coffee coupons perform best with younger adults and financially stable married individuals.

3. Restaurant (Less Than $20) Coupon Analysis
    Coupons for lower-cost restaurants attract young, budget-conscious diners, especially those who are single or unmarried.
    
    The highest acceptance (61.92%) comes from those under 30, visiting these restaurants often and earning less than $50K.
    
    Single individuals with similar habits also show strong acceptance (60.95%).
    
    Frequent diners without kids and not widowed are moderately receptive (58.17%).
    Insight: Young, lower-income, and independent eaters respond best to under-$20 restaurant coupons.

4. Restaurant ($20–$50) Coupon Analysis
    Mid-range dining coupons appeal broadly, with acceptance being consistently above 60% across various demographics.
    
    The highest acceptance (62.94%) is among those under 30 with income over $50K.
    
    Married individuals with higher income also respond well (61.86%).
    
    Even those over 30 with lower income and not married maintain a solid acceptance rate (61.01%).
    Insight: This coupon type has broad appeal, particularly among younger professionals and financially stable adults.

5. Carryaway Coupon Analysis
    Carryout coupons are moderately effective, especially among younger individuals and those with higher income, but have a lower ceiling compared to other coupon types.
    
    Best performance (59.85%) is with under-30 customers earning more than $50K.
    
    Acceptance dips slightly among older, single, lower-income individuals (57.62%) and married high-income customers (57.40%).
    Insight: Carryaway coupons are less compelling overall, though slightly more effective among young professionals.

Conclusion
  Customers most likely to accept coupons tend to be young, socially active, and value-conscious. Gender plays a modest role, with men slightly more inclined to accept offers.
